## More Info
### Data structures
* Please use the following data structures for this project. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.
	```c
	/**
	* struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
	* @n: integer
	* @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
	* @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
	*
	* Description: doubly linked list node structure
	* for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
	*/
	typedef struct stack_s
	{
			int n;
			struct stack_s *prev;
			struct stack_s *next;
	} stack_t;
	```
	```c
	/**
	* struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
	* @opcode: the opcode
	* @f: function to handle the opcode
	*
	* Description: opcode and its function
	* for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
	*/
	typedef struct instruction_s
	{
			char *opcode;
			void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
	} instruction_t;
	```
### Compilation & Output
* Your code will be compiled this way:
	```sh
	$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
	```
* Any output must be printed on `stdout`
* Any error message must be printed on `stderr`
* [Here is a link to a GitHub repository](https://github.com/ku1ik/stderred) that could help you making sure your errors are printed on `stderr`

<summary>The Monty Language</summary>
<br>
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python).<br>
It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.<br>
The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.<br>
Monty byte code files:<br>
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the ".m" extension.<br>
Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language.<br>
There is not more than one instruction per line.<br>
There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.<br>
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account.<br>
</details>

### The monty program (IMPORTANT!!!)
* Usage: `monty file`
	- where `file` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
* If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message `USAGE: monty file`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
* If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message `Error: Can't open file <file>`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
	- where `<file>` is the name of the file
* If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message `L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
	- where is the line number where the instruction appears.
	- Line numbers always start at 1
* The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
	- it executed properly every line of the file
	- it finds an error in the file
	- an error occured
* If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message `Error: malloc failed`, followed by a new line, and exit with status `EXIT_FAILURE`.
* You have to use `malloc` and `free` and are not allowed to use any other function from `man malloc` (realloc, calloc, …)

## Description of what each file shows(Tasks):

* **[bytecodes](./bytecodes/)**	-	folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use the monty interpreter.
* **[monty.h](./monty.h)**	-	holds files' function prototypes.
* **[monty.c](./monty.c)**	-	entry point of the monty byte interpreter. Starting point of the program as explained above.

		- where is the line number in the file
